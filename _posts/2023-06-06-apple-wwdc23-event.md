## Hello!

It's been a while since I've posted here. I'm just gonna use the same template as my previous Apple Event post. Anyways, MY THOUGHTS!

*Apologies for releasing this almost 20 days late. I forgot about this because of summatives and exams. Anyways,*

### 15-Inch MacBook Air

This is simply just a 15 inch version of the M2 Air, with no revisions whatsoever, other than the screen size. And it's $300 extra, in Canadian dollars. Nothing special. If you want a bigger MacBook Air, get this, I guess.

### M2 Mac Studio

I kinda forgot the Mac Studio was still on M1. It's just a SoC upgrade, nothing new.

### Apple Silicon Mac Pro

We've been waiting for this one for a while now, and now the transition to Apple Silicon is complete (beat it intel). I'm excited to see the performance of this beast of a machine, and the reviews for this.

### iOS 17

Let's look over every big feature, and small ones that I'm interested in:

- Phone related stuff: The first thing they revealed is a lockscreen-like customizable contact profile that shows up in calls and stuff. I think it's cool, I guess. Live voicemail is cool, but most voicemails I get are scam voicemails anyways.
- Messages related stuff: I like the new way you send varying forms of media in iMessage, but that UI looks off. The icons aren't Apple-like and it looks more like something you'd find in Facebook Messenger. Check In can definitely be useful for many people, especially for events to let your friends know you're there. I honestly don't use iMessage that often so some of these features don't really concern me. These stickers, swipe to reply features and search filters definitely make me feel they're adding more features that Discord already has, which is fun I guess.
- FaceTime: The reaction effects using your hand gestures is cool, though it could annoying for a lot of people, hopefully (most definitely) it will be toggleable. 
- StandBy: Now this is a feature I like. Something interesting to look at when your phone is charging! Really cool for wireless charging users (me).
- Interactive Widgets: About time. I can finally perform a task on a widget ðŸ¤¯
- NameDrop: Wait, this isn't a thing? Oh, I forgot about contact posters.
- Journal: I'm sure this is a useful app for some people, it's pretty cool, I don't really have a use for this. Who knows?
- Better Autocorrect: Awesome! Even Craig acknowledged the change from "fucking" to "ducking" with autocorrect. Let's go!! ðŸ˜‚
- Offline Maps: Useful for camping and hiking and stuff where you can easily lose signal. 
- Health: Some nice additions for mental health! A depression risk detector could be very beneficial to many people. Looking forward to it! The emotion visuals also look cool. Vision health will also definitely help, but will be annoying to some people. Kids will need it though.

Overall, nice additions, a regular old update. And, RIP iPhone X.

### iPadOS 17

I don't use my iPad much, but I do keep it on display, so they did add something that is nice for display iPads:

- Lock Screen: Finally, customziable lock screens! Why did it take another year...? Anyways, new wallpapers, new widgets, they will look awesome. Live Photo wallpapers are back too, I guess.
- Live Activities: Another one of my favorite features! Now I can see football scores and my Reddit banana count on my iPad!
- Health App: Last year the Weather app, this year the Health app, both of which look amazing on the iPad's big screen. PLEASE BRING THE HEALTH APP TO THE MAC

Every other feature is from the iPhone, so just reread the iPhone section if you wanna look at that or something. Overall, I am going to get the Public Beta, just for the lock screen.

### macOS Sonoma

I use my Mac on hours on end every single day, so I need good features to quench my thirst. Sadly, this wasn't the best year for features.

- Screen Savers: While cool, I like my classic abstract looking screen savers.
- Widgets on Desktop: I'll be using this, but Apple really wanna be Windows Vista huh? iPhone widgets on Mac will also be nice.
- Presenter Overlay: Useful. I don't make many video calls though.
- Game Mode: Interesting. Going to see how well this boosts my gaming performance, and if it really makes a difference.

That's it for macOS, just regular old new features, nothing special.

There's also no visual for macOS. So enjoy this photo of Craig.

### Audio and Home

I only really want to talk about AirPods here, so it's gonna be a short section.

- Adaptive Audio: Excited to use this, going to see how well this works in real life.

That's it. What do you want?

### watchOS 10

Best part the event for me, and a great (final?) update for my Series 4. Hopefully this isn't the end of the Series 4.

- App Redesigns: WOW. This is great. Black backgrounds no more, for most apps. They all look really cool.
- Smart Stack: Great to check your current things running wihtout switching apps. I like it.
- Side Button Change: I didn't notice in the event, but now it activates Control Center? That's more useful now.
- New Watch Faces: Eh. They're both Analog.
- Cycling Features: I WANT THIS. I bike quite often and this would be very useful. This got me hooked.

Overall, I'm getting the beta for WatchOS 10, because I want many of these changes. Looking forward to it!

Seriously? No visual again? Come on. Enjoy this placeholder image I guess.

### Apple Vision Pro

Didn't have time to write this section. Anyways, I have mixed feelings. It's cool but dystopian, as expected.

## Overall

A nice event, though I had to go near the end. I give it a solid 7/10.
